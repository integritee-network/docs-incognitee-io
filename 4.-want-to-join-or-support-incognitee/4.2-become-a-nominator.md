# 4.2 Become a Nominator

If you are a loyal TEER holder and you would like to let your TEER working for you, you should start earning TEERdays now by bonding TEER [here](https://teerdays.incognitee.io/) and join the Nominator Program <mark style="background-color:orange;">Coming soon!</mark> to nominate your TEERdays to an active Incognitee Validator to help securing Incogniteeâ€™s backbone.

As validators receive a share of the transaction fees generated by Incognitee, they can share them with TEER holders via Nomination.

If you want to express interest in becoming a nominator and want to be informed about the launch of the nominator program, we encourage you to reach out to the Integritee core team via hello@integritee.network or join Integritee Social Media channels for further announcements.
