# 4.1 Become a Validator

A validator on Incognitee has to operate a Intel SGX machine in a trustworthy datacenter setup.

To be considered as a validator in Incognitee Mainnet, you have to get whitelisted via the on-chain Governance mechanism and previously beeing active in the Test Net.

Every validator will earn from transactions. Validators will receive a proportional amount of every transaction that is beeing validated by the network based on the amount of TEERdays it has, creating an opportunity for continual rewards in line with Incognitee’s activity.\
\
The number of Incognitee validators will be limited and set by onchain Governance.\


**Technical & Operational requirements:**

* Run a Intel SGX based machine in a datacenter
* Machines that we recommend: \
  `Dell PowerEdge R340 Server`, where the CPU **must be** an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E-2276G CPU @ 3.80 GHz.
* Remote Attestation should be always valid and up to date, check [here ](https://docs.integritee.network/4-development/4.5-attesteer)how to set it up. \


**Get whitelisted via the Integritee Network on-chain-Governance:**\

\
**Get some TEER Token and earn TEERdays to increase validation commission:**

You have multiple options to obtain TEER tokens. Check out available venues [here](https://docs.integritee.network/2-integritee-network/2.4-teer-token/2.4.3-how-to-get-teer).\
\
Earn TEERdays [here](https://teerdays.incognitee.io/). \
\
**Revenue Calculation:**

Lets take a set of 5 Validators that have the following amount of TEERdays:\
\
Validator 1: 5'000 TEERdays\
Validator 2: 10'000 TEERdays\
Validator 3: 15'000 TEERdays\
Validator 4: 20'000 TEERdays\
Validator 5: 25'000 TEERdays\
\
Total amount: 75’000 TEERdays \
\
The overall revenue via transaction fees on Incognitee is lets say 1’000’000 USD per month .\
\
In this case the share of transaction fees would be as following:\
\
Validator 1: 5'000 / 75’000 \* 1’000’000 = 66’666 USD\
Validator 2: 10'000 / 75’000 \* 1’000’000 = 133’333 USD\
Validator 3: 15'000 / 75’000 \* 1’000’000 = 200’000 USD\
Validator 4: 20'000 / 75’000 \* 1’000’000 = 266’666 USD\
Validator 5: 25'000 / 75’000 \* 1’000’000 = 333’333 USD

Once Nomination becomes available, you can attract even more TEERdays via nomination that can add up to your total locked amount.\
