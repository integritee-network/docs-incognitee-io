# Sidechain

Incognitee is a shardable sidechain validated by trusted execution environments. Each shard is a separate L2 connecting to exactly one L1 chain and its native token.

The following diagram shows the Incognitee shards which are currently live:

Multiple shards could be deployed on the same L1, enabling horizontal scalability.

The Integritee Network is necessary to get finality for sidechain blocks and to verify remote attestation of validateer TEEs.

The IncogniteeDOT shard also supports bridged assets from Ethereum mainnet like USDC, USDT
