# Private Swaps

<mark style="background-color:orange;">Coming soon!</mark>

Whenever you use a centralized exchange (CEX), you trust them to operate a fair market and protect your data. Even worse, you hand over custody over your assets to them. The upside is: fast trading and something like privacy (in the best case your exposing your data and behavior to one entity only, not to the public)

If you need more autonomy, you may want to use decentralized exchanges (DEX). There, you keep custody over your assets and no single entity has the power to deny you access to the trading platform. However, this freedom comes with downsides: High latency and front-running

Incognitee can support shielding of various digital assets and offer automated market makers (AMM, similar to uniswap) on L2. This will prevent front-running because no one can see the transactions before they are executed. It also offers enhanced speed because of subsecond block times on Incognitee
