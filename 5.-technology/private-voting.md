# Private Voting

<mark style="background-color:orange;">Coming soon!</mark>

If you participate in OpenGov on Polkadot and Kusama or onchain governance on any of their parachains, you inevitably expose your voting preferences to the world. While your account can be a pseudonym, all your actions will be linkable and eventually reveal your identity. Knowing this will likely affect your voting behavior and promote conformity, obedience and submission. Vote privacy, on the other hand, rather promotes creativity, exploration and dissent.

Integritee will allow you to vote with enhanced privacy in web3 governance. This will enable you to vote freely and without fear of repercussions.

With great power comes great responsibility. For web3 governance to be legitimate, we need to strike a balance between privacy and accountability. Dominant voting power should never come with absolute privacy.
