# Build Guide

Incognitee is built on the [Integritee Sidechain SDK](https://docs.integritee.network/4-development/4.4-sdk/4.4.1-sidechain-sdk) which allows you to implement any substrate runtime with pallets of your choice or your own making. This runtime will be executed within TEE enclaves, providing a secure and private execution environment for your use case.

Would you like to 
* check the Incognitee [code on github](https://github.com/integritee-network/worker) and contribute to Incognitee or the Integritee SDK?
* fork your own sidechain project and implement your [own custom sidechain logic](https://docs.integritee.network/4-development/4.4-sdk/4.4.4-custom-business-logic-stf)?

Please visit the [Integritee SDK docs](https://docs.integritee.network/4-development/4.4-sdk/4.4.1-sidechain-sdk).
